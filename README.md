# Emory Data Mining (CS470) Code Repository
**By: Niki Vasan**

This repo holds the code I wrote for my assignments and final project in Emory's CS470 Data Mining class. This is a sequel to the CS334 foundational machine learning class I took previously (code repo can be found [here] (https://github.com/nikivasan/CS334MachineLearning)) that covers many unsupervised learning and pattern mining techniques. The topics covered in this class include:
1. Association Mining
2. Clustering
3. Similarity Analysis
4. Bayesian Nets
5. Hidden Markov Models
6. Recommender Systems

The homeworks are designed to test our ability to implement certain algorithms by hand, as well as utilize existing libraries. The final project 
allows us to apply what we have learned in this course to a real-world task. All code will pushed here as it is completed. **The homework
topics are as follows:**
1. HW1 - Introductory Data Mining Concepts
2. HW2 - Apriori Algorithm (from scratch)
3. HW3 - KMeans Algorithm (from scratch)
